# JumpLinksSwiftUI

**JumpLinksSwiftUI** is a modular SwiftUI framework for building interactive, scroll-linked tab navigation experiences. It provides seamless synchronization between a top navigation tab bar and scrollable content sections, enabling intuitive user interaction in views with multiple dynamic content areas.

This framework is ideal for building content-heavy interfaces such as onboarding flows, forms, documentation pages, or settings views where users need to quickly jump between logically separated sections.

---

## Features

- Section-based navigation: Tap on a tab to scroll to the corresponding content section.
- Scroll tracking: Automatically updates the active tab based on the current scroll position.
- SwiftUI native: Built entirely with SwiftUI using best practices and reactive data management.
- Modular design: Clean separation of UI components for ease of maintenance and customization.
- Robust state management: Leverages `@StateObject` for reliable, responsive updates during scroll or tap interactions.

## Components

- `TabBarMenuView`: The top navigation menu displaying tab options.
- `TabBarItemView`: A reusable and customizable tab button view.
- `TabBarBodySectionView`: A wrapper for each scrollable content section.
- `TabBarBodySectionListView`: The scrollable container that houses all the sections and interacts with the tab bar.
- `ScrollViewState`: An observable object that manages the currently selected tab, scroll trigger flags, and current scroll offset.
