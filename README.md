# JumpLinksSwiftUI
A customizable and dynamic scroll-aware tab navigation system for SwiftUI. ScrollViewTargetBehaviourKit allows you to create a smooth tab interface where tapping a tab scrolls to the corresponding section, and scrolling updates the selected tab â€“ all synced with state management using @StateObject. Ideal for creating views with distinct section.
